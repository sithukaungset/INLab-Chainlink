/**
 * A coordinate assignmnet operator is any function that complies with the
 * [[Operator]] interface, and assigns each node an x coordinate between zero
 * and one, respecting node order within in a layer, and the node separation
 * function.
 *
 * There are three built in coordinate assignment operators, which are all
 * constructed in a fluent fashion:
 * - [["sugiyama/twolayer/quad" | Quadratic Optimization ]] (formerly *Vert*)
 * - [["sugiyama/twolayer/greedy" | Greedy]]
 * - [["sugiyama/twolayer/center" | Center]]
 * - [["sugiyama/twolayer/topological" | Topological]]
 *
 * The operator [["sugiyama/twolayer/min-curve" | minimize curves]] is
 * deprecated as it is identical to quad with equal weights for *vertical* and
 * *curve*.
