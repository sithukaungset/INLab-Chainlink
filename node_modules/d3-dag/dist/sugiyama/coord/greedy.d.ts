/**
 * This accessor assigns coordinates as the mean of their parents and then
 * spaces them out to respect their separation. Nodes with higher degree that
 * aren't dummy nodes are given higher priority for shifting order, i.e. are
 * less likely to be moved from the mean of their parents. This solution
 * results in a layout that is more pleaseing than center, but much faster to
 * compute than vert or minCurve.
