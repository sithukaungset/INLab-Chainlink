/**
 * Compute x0 and x1 coordinates for nodes that maximizes the spread of nodes
 * in [0, 1].  It uses columnIndex that has to be present in each node. Due to
 * the varying height of the nodes, nodes from different layers might be
 * present at the same y coordinate therefore, nodes should not be centered in
 * their layer but centering should be considered over all layers.
