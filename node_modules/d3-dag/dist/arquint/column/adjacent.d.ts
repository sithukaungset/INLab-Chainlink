/**
 * Assigns column indices to the layer with most nodes first. Afterwards
 * starting from the layer with most nodes, column indices are assigned to
 * nodes in adjacent layers. Column indices are assigned with respect to the
 * node's parents or children while maintaining the same ordering in the layer.
 * In comparison to *left* and *center*, this accessor takes the adjacent layer
 * into account and tries to assign a column index that is near the column
 * index of the child or parent. Because nodes can be placed in the same column
 * even though they do not have a children/parents relation with each other,
 * nodes can overlap if nodes in different layers have different heights.
 * Therefore, the following example sets *node*.heightRatio to 1 for all nodes.
